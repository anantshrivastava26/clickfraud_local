# 🧠 Click Fraud Detection in Online Advertising (Data Orch)

### 🚀 AWS-Based Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on detecting **click fraud** in online advertising campaigns using a **machine learning pipeline** deployed entirely on **AWS**.  
It integrates multiple AWS services to build a **scalable, automated fraud detection system** capable of identifying suspicious click patterns in ad traffic.

---

## 📜 Problem Statement

Online advertising platforms lose billions due to **fraudulent clicks** generated by bots or malicious users.  
These fake clicks waste advertising budgets and distort campaign analytics.

The goal is to build a system that:
- Detects **anomalous click patterns** in ad logs.  
- Differentiates **human** vs **bot** behavior.  
- Automates the entire data pipeline on **AWS cloud infrastructure**.

## 🧩 AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **AWS Glue** | ETL and schema creation for clickstream data. |
| **Amazon Athena** | Query and analyze processed data stored in S3. |
| **AWS Lambda** | Triggered functions for automation (e.g., preprocessing, invoking model endpoint). |
| **Amazon SageMaker** | Training, hosting, and deploying the machine learning model (Isolation Forest). |
| **Amazon CloudWatch** | Logging and monitoring model performance and Lambda triggers. |
| **Amazon API Gateway** *(optional for demo)* | Exposes model endpoint as REST API for front-end or app integration. |

## 🧠 Machine Learning Overview

### Model Used: **Isolation Forest**
- **Type:** Unsupervised anomaly detection  
- **Why:** Works well without labels (ideal for unlabeled ad click data)  
- **Input Features:**
  - Click time intervals
  - Device type
  - Browser & OS fingerprint
  - User agent entropy
  - Ad campaign ID
  - IP frequency per time window
